Users Folders
`````````````

My Documents
^^^^^^^^^^^^

    ::
    
        C:\Users\<YourUserName>\Documents

Public Documents
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
    ::
    
        C:\Users\Public\Documents

Relocate the Users Folders
```````````````````````````

    * ``Right-Click`` on the folder
    * Choose **Properties**
    * Go to the **Location** tab
    * Click on **Move...**
    * Set your new path
    * Click **Apply** and close the window    

.. warning:: If you have to reinstall your system, **before to reinstall your programs**, backup your preferences.

 This extra step is necessary because the new installations will overwrite the previous working setttings.
 
 A simple workaround is to create a ``Backup`` folder (the name doesn't really matter) inside those folders and ``Drag`n`Drop`` inside your previous working preferences.

 When your programs will be reinstalled, just ``Copy`` ``Paste`` the previous working preferences from the Backup folders to your `User Folders`_.

.. note:: Some programs store their preferences in other specific locations. 

 For those exceptions, to keep your program preferences centralized, read the documentation of your program and relocate everything inside your relocated user folders.
