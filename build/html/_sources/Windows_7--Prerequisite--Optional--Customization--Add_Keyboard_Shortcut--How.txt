How to do it
============

Access
------

Shortcut Properties
```````````````````

    * ``Right-Click`` on a shortcut
    * Choose **Properties**
    * Go to the **Shortcut** tab

Edit
----

Assign a keyboard shortcut to a program
```````````````````````````````````````
    * Access the `Shortcut Properties`_
    * Inside the **Shortcut key** field press a letter
    * Click **Apply** to apply the changes
    * Close the window

.. note:: This will assign a keyboard shortcut with ``Ctrl + Alt`` as base, following by the key you pressed.

.. tip:: ``Backspace`` inside the **Shortcut key** field to go back to the default value

.. warning:: Few programs need to be inside the `Start Menu`_ before to be accessible by a keyboard shortcut.

.. warning:: If you encounter the **WinError06** when you are trying to build a C++ project this is because you renamed and/or your added a keyboard shortcut to your Sublime Text 3 shortcut.

 This issue happens on the Sublime Text 3 portable version. Not sure if with the installer it does the same.

 This issue is a bit annoying and I didn't find a solution yet.

 If someone find a solution to this issue and see this S.O.S. please send me and email at :

.. tip:: You don't need to add keyboard shortcut to every single program. If you plan to be a developer for example just add a quick access to your terminal, your text editor, your web browser and your media player because sometimes it saves your life.
