Why do you have to do it
------------------------

**Sublime Text 2** is based on **Python 2.6** (also compatible with higher versions but inferior to the version 3) and **Sublime Text 3** on **Python 3** (or higher).

**By default Python is not installed on Windows systems** and if you want to take the best of Sublime Text, especially the plugin ecosystem, you need to have the right dedicated version of `Python installed`_.
