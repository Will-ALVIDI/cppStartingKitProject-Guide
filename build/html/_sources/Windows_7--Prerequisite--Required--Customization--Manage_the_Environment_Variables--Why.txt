Why do you have to do it
========================

Sometimes you need to allow your programs to communicate between each other but by default this behavior doesn't exist.

The only link between all your programs is your system.

If you want to make a program visible to other programs you have to specify it to your system.

That's what the `environment variables`_ does.

You can specify a group with the paths to the programs you want to be accessible and your system allow the connection.
