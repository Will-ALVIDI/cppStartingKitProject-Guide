Philosophy
----------

The **Linux Shell** is an amazing, fantastic, tremendous productivity tool. 

It allows you to control a lot of daily local and remote tasks more efficiently and smoothly than the standard **Windows 7** mouse based workflow.

If you follow this guide from the beginning you installed `MinGW -w64`_ without `Msys`_.

It means that you only have the **GCC compiler tools** but you don't have a **Linux shell**.

`Git for Windows`_, in addition to **Git commands**, contains a **Linux shell**.

This part of the guide will help you to set up `Console 2`_ as a front end terminal and use it to login automatically to the `Git for Windows`_ **Linux shell**.

You will be able to use more efficiently `MinGW -w64`_ and take the benefit of the other integrated **Linux Shell** functionalities.

Goals
-----

    * Access your terminal from everywhere
    * Use your terminal inside Sublime Text
    * Open softwares from your terminal
    * Open files with specific software from your terminal
    * Launch Linux and Windows scripts from your terminal 

.. warning:: **This part of the guide is not**

    * A full integration of the Linux Shell
    * A course on the Linux Shell
    * A course on gcc tools usage
    * A course on Git for Windows usage
 
.. tip:: **If you are a beginner in Linux Shell usage** follow strictly this part of the guide and use your freshly build terminal to learn the basis of

    * Linux Shell commands
    * gcc tools commands (MinGW -w64)
    * git commands

 Invest time in learning those tools is far to be a waste of time.
