.. warning:: Most of the time the maintainer of the package left a **post installation message** : A file will open with some instructions after the installation.

 **Please take the time to read them**, they always have critical informations about the package like the link to the documentation, the post installation processes, the usage or/and the known issues.
 
 **99.999999999... % of the time** this will avoid you to waste your time and ask questions on forums or issue trackers that already have an answer.
     
.. tip:: **Fuzzy searching**

 As the **Control Panel** uses, like other searching tools in Sublime Text, a **fuzzy searching**, you don't have to enter the entire words or expressions to obtain the good result, as well as the order doesn't matter.
 
 You can type what follows and still see the good result appear :
 ::
    
    install package
    control install
    pack inst
    inst pack
    pa in
