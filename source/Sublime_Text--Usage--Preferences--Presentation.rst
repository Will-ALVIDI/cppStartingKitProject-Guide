Manage your **Preferences** in Sublime Text 3 is a crucial step to enhance your workflow.

To understand the **Preferences** management you must understand that each component of **Sublime Text**, from the text editor itself to the external plugins, has 2 files which compose its settings, both in JSON language : a **Default Settings** file and a **User Settings** file.

The **Default Settings** file sets the default settings and provides by including comments a reference for the **User Settings** file. 

All the **User Settings** files are stored in the `User Packages`_ folder.
