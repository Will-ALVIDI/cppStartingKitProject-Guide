Create a Shortcut folder
========================

Why do you have to do it
------------------------

The concept of this **Shortcut folder** is to allow your terminal to communicate with **Windows 7**.

You have to add this **Shortcut folder** to the environment variables and everything inside will be accessible by your terminal.

Inside this path you will put your Windows program shortcuts, Windows scripts, terminal messages then add aliases and shell scripts to execute your newly defined commands.

.. note:: There are many ways to configure Console 2 and set your aliases but this solution is for me the simplest.
