SAVE SUBLIME LINTER !!!
=======================

`Sublime Linter <http://sublimelinter.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html>`_ is a Sublime Text plugin for code linting. 

I don't have the knowledges to help the author to maintain it but I don't want to see this project die because **it is one of the most useful plugin available for Sublime Text**.

Here is the `original message <https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3/issues/146>`_ from the author :

" After a year of working on SublimeLinter, the time has come for me to pass the torch. I am grateful to everyone who valued SublimeLinter enough to donate, and also to those who contributed code, but I can no longer afford to maintain or support SublimeLinter and its many linter plugins.

I am looking for developers who are willing to take over coding and/or support. If you are interested, please leave a comment here." 

If you think you can and want to help please show your interest `here <https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter3/issues/148>`_.
